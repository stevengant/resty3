## Project: useState() Hook
*RESTy Phase 2*

### Author: Steve Gant

### Problem Domain  

In phase 2, we will be receiving user input in preparation of connecting to live APIs, using the `useState()` hook in our functional components. In order to properly manage state with the useState hook, we will now convert `<App />` to a functional component.
